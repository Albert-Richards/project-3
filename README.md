## Brief

The brief for the DevOps Final Project is to deploy an application for a 'Spring Pet Clinicâ€™ domain where we have a front end client using AngularJS and an API using Java.

<a name="reqs"></a>
### Requirements 

The requirements of the project, retrieved from the [QA-Community website](https://qa-community.co.uk/~/_/projects/final--devops) are as follows:

You will need to plan, design and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of this application. As part of your final deliverable you will need to discuss the project in a presentation and demonstrate these workflows

Using what you have learned consider the following:

-What tools will work for you best? For example: Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible etc. There is no restrictions or requirements on which ones to use; you should decide which you feel are most appropriate and justify their use

-Multiple Environment support: How can a developer test their new features on an environment before merging their changes to the main branch?

-How can changes on the GitHub repository automatically build and deploy to testing and live environments?

-Running costs. What are your monthly estimates? How could they be improved?

<a name="building"></a>
### Building the Deployment Structure
In order to fulfill the requirements of the project, we chose to deploy the application via the use of Terraform, Kubernetes, Jenkins and Docker as well as using Amazon Web Services as our cloud provider

<a name="planning"></a>
### Project Planning

The project planning was done through a Trello board. This consists of a Backlog, sprint, MOSCOW order of prioritisation as well as items to check on completion. Updates were made to this board constantly throughout development.

### Services


#### Terraform


#### Kubernetes



#### Jenkins


#### Service 4


<a name="test_2/3"></a>
### Service 2 & 3 tests

Using Unittest.mock and pytest basic tests were done for both Service 2 & Service 3 to see that the return values were randomly generated. 2 different methods were used. 

**Service 2 test**: complete test can be found at [test_service_2.py](https://github.com/InaamIslam/DevOps_Project2/blob/develop/service2/testing/test_service2.py)

```bash
class TestService2(TestBase):
    def test_all_cities(self):
        for _ in range(20):
            response = self.client.get(url_for('city'))
            self.assertIn(response.data.decode("utf-8"),["London", "Barcelona", "Milan", "Tokyo"])

class TestService2(TestBase):
    def test_London(self):
        with patch('random.choice') as s:
            s.return_value = 'London'
            response = self.client.get(url_for('city'))
            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
            self.assertEqual(b'London', response.data)
```
**Service 3 test**: complete test can be found at [test_service_3.py](https://github.com/InaamIslam/DevOps_Project2/blob/develop/service3/testing/test_service3.py)

```bash
class TestService3(TestBase):
    def test_all_activities(self):
        for _ in range(20):
            response = self.client.get(url_for('activity'))
            self.assertIn(response.data.decode("utf-8"),["Paintballing", "Surfing", "Snorkelling", "Skiing"])

class TestService2(TestBase):
    def test_paintballing(self):
        with patch('random.choice') as s:
            s.return_value = 'Paintballing'
            response = self.client.get(url_for('activity'))
            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
            self.assertEqual(b'Paintballing', response.data)
```

<a name="test_4"></a>
### Service 4 test

The unittest.mock method was again used to get mock values of Service 2 and Service 3 and then check that the return value would be accurate as according to the dictates of the programming. 

**Service 4 test**: complete test can be found at [test_service_4.py](https://github.com/InaamIslam/DevOps_Project2/blob/develop/service4/testing/test_service4.py)

```bash
class TestResponse(TestBase):

    def test_London_Paintball(self):
        with patch('requests.get') as a:
            a.return_value.text = 'London'
            with patch('random.randrange') as b:
                    b.return_value = 'Paintballing'
                    response = self.client.post(
                        url_for('price'),
                        data = 'London Paintballing')
                    self.assertEqual(b'200', response.data)
```

## Architecture

![project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84901993/128856042-b2d79c13-e9f6-4b02-bff1-86f103de27de.png)
A microservice application architectured through building objects & containerisation 

<img src="/documentation/userservice1.png" alt="" width="50%" height="50%"/>

This is an updated version. The applications connect on different ports for each of the 4 services, 5001, 5002, and 5003 respectivley.

### Container level architecture
The container level architecture was designed as below:

### Application Infrastructure

<a name="ci"></a>
## Continous Integration Pipeline 

This is my final version for my CI pipeline. My cluster was confirgured with two nodes. Ansible and Jenins were installed in separate Virtual machines. A MySQL GCP instance was used for the Database. The pipeline allowed for a lean and agile approach to implementing the application. 


The jenkinsfile shows a 5 step process that would allow for the testing, installation, configuration and deployment of the app.

## Risk Assessment

I considered a number of risks that could take place in the development and use of the application

## Things that went well 

A number of things went well for me on this project:

* Microservice Apllication
    - I was able to develop the applicationa and containerise using Docker
    - I was able to deploy this as part of a swarm using Docker Compose
* Jenkins
    - I was able to build, test, deploy and configure using Jenkins
    - rolling updates were possible through webhooks and CI/CD
* Linux
    - User Administration
    - Sudoers 
    - SSH




<a name="improve"></a>
## Areas for improvement:

* NGINX -load balancer -This would have been useful but not entirley required as the Docker Swarm is able to load balance and so I decided to use NGINX as a reverse proxy only. 

* Implementing the use of JSON to increase data parsing speed, and also as part of sending data between services. 

* Adding an Email server into my Jenkins CI pipeline to send build notifications
